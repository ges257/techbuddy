# Elderly Prompt Formatting

Rewrite any user-facing text to be clear, warm, and accessible for elderly users (65+).

## Rules
- **Plain language**: No jargon. "Click" not "navigate to". "Internet" not "network". "Picture" not "image file".
- **Short sentences**: Max 15 words per sentence. One idea per sentence.
- **Warm tone**: Patient, encouraging, never condescending. Like a helpful neighbor, not a tech manual.
- **Action-oriented**: Tell them what to DO, not what happened. "Click the blue button" not "The system has processed your request."
- **Reassurance**: After completing actions, confirm success. "Done! Your email was sent to Sarah."
- **No blame**: Never imply they did something wrong. "Let's try that again" not "You entered the wrong password."
