This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a clear aesthetic direction:
- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick a direction — minimalist, warm, refined, playful, editorial, soft/pastel, etc.
- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute with precision. The key is intentionality, not intensity.

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful and distinctive. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter. Pair a display font with a refined body font.
- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.
- **Motion**: Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions.
- **Spatial Composition**: Generous negative space OR controlled density. Intentional, not random.
- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth. Gradient meshes, subtle textures, layered transparencies, soft shadows.

NEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics: overused fonts (Inter, Roboto, Arial), cliched purple gradients on white, predictable layouts, cookie-cutter design.

**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Minimalist designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.
